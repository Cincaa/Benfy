# Benfy

By creating this page, I aimed to provide Romainian users with the option of examining data in terms of correlation with the Benford distribution, while also investigating some actual, concrete situations and popularizing Benford's Law as a tool for detecting fraud. 

This is also my bachelor's degree project.
